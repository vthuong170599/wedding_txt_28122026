## Idea 1: "Eternal Bloom" - Romantic & Soft

*   **Design Movement**: Romanticism / Soft Minimalism
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Tenderness**: Every interaction should feel gentle and soft.
    *   **Flow**: Content should flow like a gentle stream or falling petals.
    *   **Intimacy**: Focus on the couple's connection through close-up imagery and warm tones.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Palette**: Soft Blush Pink (#F1D4D4), Warm Cream (#FAFAFA), Muted Gold (#D4AF37), and Deep Rose (#8B4513 for text).
    *   **Intent**: Evoke feelings of warmth, love, and new beginnings. The soft pinks and creams create a dreamy atmosphere, while gold adds a touch of celebration.
*   **Layout Paradigm**:
    *   **Asymmetric & Organic**: Avoid rigid grids. Use overlapping elements and organic shapes (like flower petals) to frame images and text.
    *   **Floating Elements**: Sections drift into view rather than snapping into place.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Falling Petals**: A subtle, continuous background animation of falling cherry blossom or rose petals.
    *   **Watercolor Textures**: Soft watercolor washes behind text blocks or as image borders.
    *   **Handwritten Accents**: Key headings and names in a flowing script, looking like a love letter.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**:
    *   **Gentle Parallax**: Slow, soothing movement of background layers.
    *   **Soft Hovers**: Buttons and images bloom (scale up slightly and brighten) when interacted with.
*   **Animation**:
    *   **Fade & Float**: Elements fade in and float upwards slowly.
    *   **Smooth Scroll**: A custom smooth scroll implementation to enhance the "floating" feel.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *Great Vibes* or *Pinyon Script* (Elegant, flowing script).
    *   **Body**: *Lato* or *Cormorant Garamond* (Clean but with character).

## Idea 2: "Vintage Love Letter" - Nostalgic & Classic

*   **Design Movement**: Vintage / Classic Elegant
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Timelessness**: A design that feels like it could belong to any era.
    *   **Storytelling**: The site feels like reading a cherished book or letter.
    *   **Detail**: Intricate borders, paper textures, and classic typography.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Palette**: Aged Paper (#FDFBF7), Charcoal Ink (#333333), Antique Gold (#C5A059), and Faded Sage (#8F9779).
    *   **Intent**: Create a sense of history and enduring love. The paper tones and ink colors mimic a physical wedding invitation or an old love letter.
*   **Layout Paradigm**:
    *   **Editorial / Print-Inspired**: Layouts that resemble magazine spreads or classic book pages.
    *   **Centered & Balanced**: More traditional alignment for a formal, dignified feel, but broken up by asymmetric image collages.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Paper Texture**: A subtle grain or paper texture overlay on the background.
    *   **Ornate Dividers**: Classic flourishes or line art separators between sections.
    *   **Wax Seal**: A digital "wax seal" animation for the RSVP button or opening sequence.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**:
    *   **Unfolding**: Sections reveal themselves like unfolding a letter.
    *   **Tactile Feel**: Buttons have a "pressed" state that mimics physical buttons or paper embossing.
*   **Animation**:
    *   **Draw-in**: Line art and borders draw themselves in.
    *   **Typewriter Effect**: Some text appears character by character (subtly).
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *Cinzel* or *Playfair Display* (Classic serif with high contrast).
    *   **Body**: *Lora* or *EB Garamond* (Readable serif for a book-like feel).
    *   **Accents**: *Monsieur La Doulaise* (Intricate script for very short highlights).

## Idea 3: "Starlight Symphony" - Modern & Magical

*   **Design Movement**: Modern Luxury / Celestial
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Radiance**: The design should glow and sparkle.
    *   **Depth**: Use of dark backgrounds and light elements to create deep, immersive space.
    *   **Celebration**: High energy, focusing on the joy and the party.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Palette**: Deep Midnight Blue (#0F172A), Starlight Silver (#E2E8F0), Champagne Gold (#FCD34D), and Soft White (#F8FAFC).
    *   **Intent**: Capture the magic of a night wedding under the stars. Dark backgrounds make photos pop and create a premium, cinematic feel.
*   **Layout Paradigm**:
    *   **Cinematic / Full-Screen**: Large, full-screen imagery and video backgrounds.
    *   **Layered Depth**: Elements sit on different "planes" to maximize the parallax effect.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Sparkles/Fireflies**: Subtle glowing particles moving in the background.
    *   **Glassmorphism**: Translucent, frosted glass cards for text content over the dark background.
    *   **Golden Gradients**: Text and borders with a metallic gold gradient finish.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**:
    *   **Immersive**: The user feels like they are entering a different world.
    *   **Spotlight**: Hovering over items illuminates them or creates a glow effect.
*   **Animation**:
    *   **Shimmer**: Gold elements shimmer periodically.
    *   **Zoom & Pan**: Background images slowly zoom or pan to keep the scene alive.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *Bodoni Moda* or *Prata* (High-contrast modern serif).
    *   **Body**: *Montserrat* or *Raleway* (Clean geometric sans-serif).
    *   **Accents**: *Alex Brush* (Fluid script for contrast).
